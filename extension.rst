Extensions
===========

The default program is shipped without any extensions.

Here is a list of available extensions. To enable them, you need to re-compile
the program with appropriate flags.

1. Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) framework. This extension uses IDR to call
peaks. Flag: ``idr``.

2. Sun Grid Engine (SGE). This extension allows program run on a SGE system.
Flag: ``sge``.
